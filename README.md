# Nix Project Setup CLI

## What
An opinionated CLI that helps with setting up projects from flake-based templates 

## Why
Got tired doing these things manually

## Implemented/Planned (the list will most likely be changed a lot in the nearest future):
- [x] Rust
  - [x] nix-cargo-integration (I use this one for everything, so dont feel the need to add more templates)
- [ ] Cpp
- [ ] DotNet
  - [ ] C#
  - [ ] F#
- [ ] Python
- [ ] JS/TS
- [ ] Devenv

### Note
If you've got ideas of what to add, or want to implement a feature yourself, feel free to create an issue for a discussion, as I don't want people to work on 
something just to get it rejected if I see it unfit for this project. If I agree on the feature, feel free to send a pull request whenever you feel it's ready to be merged.

## Other Notes
API is veeeeeery much work-in-progress, so expect tonns of changes in the near future
